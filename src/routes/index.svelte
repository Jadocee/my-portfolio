	<AboutMe>
		I'm a student studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering at the University of Newcastle,
		starting my second year in February, 2022. My goal is to pursue a career in software development
		by pursuing new learning opportunities and forming relationships with the individuals I meet on
		my journey. Developing cross-platform applications is at the top of my list of skills to learn.
		However, I am open to take on other development opportunities or change my path as I explore
		other options. I hope to soon gain leadership and development experience through a work
		experience related program such as an internship
