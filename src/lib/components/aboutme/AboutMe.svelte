				I'm a student studying a Bachelor of Software Engineering at the University of Newcastle,
				starting my second year in February, 2022. My goal is to pursue a career in software
				development by pursuing new learning opportunities and forming relationships with the
				individuals I meet on my journey. Developing cross-platform applications is at the top of my
				list of skills to learn. However, I am open to take on other development opportunities or
				change my path as I explore other options. I hope to soon gain leadership and development
				experience through a work experience related program such as an internship
